                    A Data-Driven Approach to Environmental Insights,
                    This project successfully utilized advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques to analyze toxic release trends across the U.S. Toxics Release Inventory (TRI). By employing tools like predictive modeling, data visualization, and statistical exploration, the study achieved the following key outcomes.
